*[Category: LinkedIn/Industry Commentary]*
**What:** Share and comment on fleet dash cam AI article with Xtract positioning
**Why:** Perfect timing - article discusses AI telematics era while we have full Geotab + Lytx integration proof points
**Action:** Share article with comment: "AI dash cams are evolving fast, but the real value comes from integrating that footage with telematics data and structured FNOL capture. When everything connects seamlessly, fleet managers get the complete picture instantly."
**Source:** Industry News: https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQb1hSS3FSU0lyejUxVVZFSW5zUy1sQ2U2WHpmdkJMZkxLakM2X05UQzh2Q0NONlI5RTJFZk5IMmRYSzc3enNaS1V0TEhRR0JqazlEOTZMSHBqVDc3TFRWY1dfbjJ5VmxudFE5VXBpUnlnUnZqOFhiWGhxNmdCT2hDZGh0cWg5T3RmWWNCTEZvQlFxYmo1blBLX3hyVTlWdw?oc=5

**Quick Win #2** ⚡ (10-15 min)
*[Category: LinkedIn/Industry Commentary]*
**What:** Comment on the "telematics provider targets fleet insurance" article with multi-provider integration angle
**Why:** Positions Xtract as telematics-agnostic while everyone else locks into single providers
**Action:** Comment: "Interesting to see more telematics providers targeting insurance directly. The challenge isn't choosing one provider - it's making all the different telematics systems work together for insurers who cover diverse fleets. Integration flexibility matters more than vendor lock-in."

**Quick Win #3** ⚡ (5-10 min)
*[Category: LinkedIn/Industry Commentary]*
**What:** Share the "claims remain insurance's blind spot" article with Xtract value prop
**Why:** Article perfectly sets up our FNOL/early data capture value proposition
**Action:** Share with comment: "💡 'Claims remain insurance's blind spot' - exactly why first notice of loss is so critical. The sooner insurers get complete, structured data (not just a phone call), the faster everything downstream improves. Technology won't fix claims if the initial data capture is still broken."
